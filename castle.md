# Castle


Because modern web apps can be simple

### Intro

Adopting big web frameworks like Angular or React makes you tied with technologies and tools that creates heavy applications and requires hours of learning on islands of technicalities that will become obsolete in few years.
Castle is diferent because it is simple and small.

With Castle you have the opportunity to work with a simple framework, understanding the internals, improving, customizing and contributing.

I am not kidding, the Castle runtime is less than 500 lines of unminified JavaScript. The tools are small and you can create your own if you wish.

Castle just adds the missing bits to make life more productive, and can be used with Javascript or Typescript.

Castle does not requires a very modern browser to work. No surprises.

### Get started

Download here [castle.zip](castle.zip)

Open a command line as administrator and type

```
castle install
```

This will add Castle to your system path.

Choose a directory to create your first app and type:

```
castle create MyApp
cd MyApp
```
This will create a folder with a sample application.

Castle does not depends on Typescript, but it is a good tool to have.
The default application configures Typescript and the Visual Studio Code.

Open the folder and select the menu Terminal "Run Build Task..."

This will compile ts files generating js files.

Now  we are ready to build

```
castle build
```

And you application is ready. See indexD.html
