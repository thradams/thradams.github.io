An integer represents a finite and contable quantity.
Integers also denote zero and negative numbers.

..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 .... 

are all integers. 
The set of integers is infinite and it is called Z.

In decimal notation we have 9 symbols to represent a quantity and one to represent zero. After that, we reuse the same symbols in a positional way.
For instance, 10 means  have alread used 9 symbols to count. After that, start with zero and 1.
