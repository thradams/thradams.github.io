<h1 id="toc_0">Ownership checks for C</h1>

<h2 id="toc_1">Abstract</h2>

<p>In C, resources such as memory are managed manually. For example, we utilize the <code>malloc</code> function to allocate memory and store the resulting address in a variable. When the memory is no longer needed, we need the address returned by <code>malloc</code> to be able to call <code>free</code>.  </p>

<p>Therefore, the variable holding the address is considered the owner of the memory, as this address cannot be simply discarded, otherwise we have a memory leak.</p>

<p>Resource leaks pose a significant challenge as they tend to be silent problems that don&#39;t immediately impact a program&#39;s behavior or cause immediate issues. Moreover, they can easily go unnoticed during unit tests, creating a false sense of security. Therefore, it is absolutely crucial to address and track these problems early on. By doing so, not only can potential complications be prevented, but it can also save valuable time and resources in the long run.</p>

<p>To check the correctness of owner variables this proposal suggests new type qualifiers <code>owner</code>, <code>view</code> and <code>obj_owner</code> and a move assignment.</p>

<p>The <code>owner</code> qualifier will qualify the variable as the <code>owner</code> and <code>view</code> can be used to override (negate) <code>owner</code>.</p>

<p>Owner variables cannot be discarded, they must be <em>moved</em> or <em>destroyed</em>.</p>

<p>The <code>obj_owner</code> is a special case of <code>owner</code> pointer and it will be explained later.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Syntax</h2>

<p>The syntax of owner qualifier is similar of const and others. </p>

<pre><code class="language-c">owner int handle;

void * owner ptr = malloc(1);

int arr[owner 10];
</code></pre>

<p>structs/unions/enuns can be qualified at declaration.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">owner struct X { ... };
</code></pre>

<h2 id="toc_3">Variable checks</h2>

<p>When a owner variable leaves scope without begin moved/destroy we have this warning. </p>

<pre><code class="language-c">int main() {
  void * owner p = malloc(1);
} //warning variable p not moved/destroyed
</code></pre>

<h2 id="toc_4">Owner pointer checks</h2>

<p>When we have owner pointer to a owner object, the compiler will check if both, pointer and pointed object are moved/destroyed before the end of scope.  </p>

<pre><code class="language-c">owner struct X { ... };
int main() {
 struct X * owner p = calloc(1, sizeof(*p));
 x_destroy(p);
 free(p);
}//ok
</code></pre>

<h2 id="toc_5">Move assignment</h2>

<p>The <em>move assignment</em> also <em>move initialization</em> is used to transfer the ownership of some owner variable to another owner variable.</p>

<p>For the variable receiving the value, we have a situation similar of leaving the scope. Compiler must check if the variable is uninitialized or null before receiving the new value.</p>

<p>After the <em>move assignment</em> / <em>move initialization</em> the source variable became uninitialized. The uninitialized is just conceptual state, nothing changes at runtime.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">void * owner p1 = malloc(1);
void * owner p2 = nullptr;
p2 = move p1;
free(p2);
</code></pre>

<p>If we try to use p1 after move, we receive a warning &quot;using a uninitialized variable&quot;.</p>

<p>We can assign a owner variable to a non owned variable.
In this case we have a view only.</p>

<h2 id="toc_6">Moving to function arguments</h2>

<p>Passing a variable to a function is very similar of assignment. The same rules apply.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">owner struct list {...};
owner struct node {...};

struct list list = {0};
struct node node = {0}
...
list_add(&amp;list, move node);
</code></pre>

<h2 id="toc_7">Implicit move</h2>

<p>Some moves are so obvious that we can make them optional. For instance, free, close, destroy and delete are good candidates.
For this job we can use the attribute [[implicit]].</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">void list_destroy([[implicit]] struct list l) { }

int main()
{
  owner struct list {...};
  list_destroy(list);
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="toc_8">Returning owner type</h2>

<p>Returning a owner variable is the same of moving it and it is implicit.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">struct list make()
{
  struct list {...};
  return list;
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="toc_9">obj_owner qualifier</h2>

<p>We can create destructors like this</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">void x_destroy([[implicit]] struct list list) {
}

int main()
{
  struct list list = {};
  x_destroy(list);
}
</code></pre>

<p>But we may want to create destructor passing pointers.
The problem is that a owner pointer is owner of both memory and the object but for objects allocated on the stack we want to destroy only the object.</p>

<p>The <code>obj_owner</code> qualifier was created basically to allow destructors to be implemented as:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">void x_destroy([[implicit]] struct list* obj_owner list) {
}

int main()
{
  struct list list = {};
  x_destroy(&amp;list);
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="toc_10">Owner arrays</h2>

<p>As expected arrays and pointer are related. However, a parameter of owner array type is equivalent of <code>obj_owner</code>.  </p>

<pre><code class="language-c">void array_destroy(int n, struct X a[owner n])
{
}

int main()
{
  struct X a[owner 100];
  array_destroy(100, a);
}
</code></pre>

<p>We can pass owner pointer to onwer array parameters, but then we also need to free.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">void array_destroy(int n, struct X a[owner n])
{
}

int main()
{
  struct X * owner p = calloc(100, sizeof(struct X));
  array_destroy(100, p);
  free(p);
}
</code></pre>

<p>We also can use owner pointers</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">void array_delete(int n, struct X * owner p)
{
}

int main()
{
  struct X * owner p = calloc(100, sizeof(struct X));
  array_delete(100, p);  
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="toc_11">Reality check I</h2>

<p>Let&#39;s check if these rules can help us with <code>fopen/fclose</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">FILE* owner fopen(char const* name,char const* mode);
int fclose([[implicit]] FILE* owner f);
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-c">int main() {
  FILE * owner p = fopen(&quot;text.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;);
  if (p) {
    fclose(p);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We have a problem, because the not all control paths are calling the destructor and the compiler will emit an warning.</p>

<p>However, the code is correct because we don&#39;t need, and we cannot, call fclose on null pointer.</p>

<p>To solve this problem we also need null-checks in your static analyzer.  </p>

<p>The compiler will not emit warning if it can prove that a owner variable is empty or uninitialized at the end of scope. </p>

<h2 id="toc_12">Reality check II</h2>

<pre><code class="language-c">onwer struct book {
    char * owner title;
};

void book_destroy(struct book * obj_owner book) { 
  free(book-&gt;title);
}

void book_delete([[implicit]] struct book* owner book) {
    if (book) {
       book_destroy(book);
       free(book);
    }
}
owner struct books {
    struct book * owner * owner data;
    int size;
    int capacity;
};

void books_destroy([[implicit]] struct books * obj_owner books) 
{
   for (int i = 0; i &lt; books-&gt;size; i++) {
     book_delete(books-&gt;data[i]);
   }
   free(books-&gt;data);
}

int books_push_back(struct books* p, 
                    struct book* owner book)
{
    //... 
    p-&gt;data[p-&gt;size] = move book;
    //...
}

int main() 
{
   struct books books = {};
   struct book* owner book = calloc(1, sizeof (struct book));
   if (book == NULL) goto continuation;
   
   book-&gt;title = strdup(&quot;book1&quot;);
   if (book-&gt;title == NULL) goto continuation;
   
   if (books_push_back(&amp;books, move book) == 0) {
     book = NULL;
   }
 continuation:
  book_delete(book);
  books_destroy(&amp;books);
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="toc_13">Checking the rules III</h2>

<pre><code class="language-c">int main()
{
  FILE * owner f = NULL;
  if (fopen_s( &amp;f,&quot;f.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;) == 0)  {
    fclose(f);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem here is that in previous fopen we could check for null to decide if we need or not a warning if the destructor is not called.</p>
