## About

I am a professional C and C++ programmer with many years of experience, mainly 
in the Windows operating system, using C/C++ and many libraries 
including MFC, ATL (DCOM/COM), STL, Boost, Win API and WTL.

In the past years, I have been working on software for industrial 
automation (at Elipse Software), Digital Radio (at Radioscape) and 
internet video streaming (at Rawflow). The last two are based in 
London and previous one in South of Brazil which is the company I am 
currently working for.
