<h1 id="toc_0">Ownership checks for C</h1>

<p>The static ownership check is an experimental feature in Cake.
It consists of two separate implementations. </p>

<p>Part I focuses on introducing the concept of an owner qualifier in the type system and does not requires flow analysis. </p>

<p>Part II requires flow analysis, ensuring that owned resources are appropriately released when necessary.   </p>

<p>By implementing the static ownership check, and using the feature on it&#39;s own source, Cake aims to explore and evaluate the effectiveness of this feature.  </p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Part I - Type system changes</h2>

<h3 id="toc_2">New qualifiers</h3>

<ul>
<li>owner</li>
<li>view</li>
<li>obj_owner</li>
</ul>

<p>An <strong>owner object</strong> is a object that have one or more references to other(s) object(s) which the lifetime it controls. A owner object is the unique owner of the referenced object(s). The <strong>owner</strong> qualifier is used to create a <strong>owner object</strong>. The most common owner object are pointers, and we can also call them as <strong>owner pointers</strong>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">  struct X * owner p = calloc(1, sizeof * p);    
  //...
  free(p);
</code></pre>

<p>We can have other types of <strong>owner objects</strong> that are not pointers. For instance:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">owner int sfd =  socket(rp-&gt;ai_family,
   rp-&gt;ai_socktype,
   rp-&gt;ai_protocol);  
</code></pre>

<p>An <strong>owner object</strong> can be an aggregate  </p>

<pre><code class="language-c">struct X {
 char * owner name;
 struct Y * owner p;
}; 

char * owner names[10];

</code></pre>

<p><strong>Owner pointers</strong>, assumes ownership of the pointed object and its memory as if the ownership were to two different objects.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">struct X { char * owner text; };   
int main() {
  struct X * owner p = malloc(1);  
  free(p-&gt;text); //moving the ownership of object
  free(p); //moving ownership of the memory  
}
</code></pre>

<p>The memory of an owner pointer is moved when we move it to an <code>void * owner</code>. More details on semantics.  </p>

<p>A <strong>view object</strong> is an object that does not have references to other objects, or if it has, it is does not owns the references which must exist beyond the lifespan of the view object itself. We call <strong>view pointer</strong> a pointer that does not own the pointed object.</p>

<p>Its is not necessary to use the <strong>view</strong> qualifier, because this is the default.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">void * owner p = malloc(1);
if (p) {
  void * view p2 = p;
  void * p3 = p;
}
free(p);
</code></pre>

<p>When a <strong>view</strong> qualifier is used with structs/unions, all <strong>owner objects</strong> members becomes <strong>view objects</strong>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c"> struct X{
   char * owner text;
 };
 
 int main() {
   view struct X x = {0};
   // x.text is a view reference
 }
</code></pre>

<p>An <strong>object owner pointer</strong> is a version of <strong>owner pointer</strong> with the difference that is is responsible only for the lifetime of the pointed object, but not responsible for it&#39;s memory lifetime. The <strong>obj_owner</strong> qualifier is used exclusively with pointers. The most common usage of <strong>object owner pointer</strong> is when creating destructors.  </p>

<p>Sample:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">
struct X { char * owner text; };  

void x_destroy(struct X * obj_owner p)  
{
  free(p-&gt;text);
}  

int main() {
  struct X x= {0};
  ...  
  x_destroy(&amp;x); //object moved
  free(p); //memory moved
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>object owner pointer</strong> to <strong>non owner objects</strong> does not make sense.   </p>

<pre><code class="language-c">struct point {int x, y; };  
void point_destroy(struct point * obj_owner p) //error  
void destroy2(void * obj_owner p) //error
void destroy3(char * obj_owner p) //error
</code></pre>

<p><strong>object owner pointer</strong> to incomplete types does not make sense.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">struct X;
void point_destroy(struct X * obj_owner p) //error  
</code></pre>

<p>(Maybe this can be verified at caller)</p>

<p>Considering that the objective of <strong>owner pointers</strong> is to control the lifetime of the referenced object, it does not make sense a owner pointer to functions.</p>

<p>The exactly name of the new qualifiers still not defined. It can be something like <code>_Owner</code> or just <code>owner</code> or attributes.    </p>

<p>My suggestion is to have macros for each qualifier to be able to compile the same source code in compilers that don&#39;t support ownership checks. </p>

<h3 id="toc_3">Semantics</h3>

<p>1 - When a <strong>owner object</strong> is copied to another <strong>owner object</strong> the ownership is moved.</p>

<p>The destination owner object must not hold any resource at the moment of copy. This is natural on initialization, function arguments and returning objects. For assignment, flow analysis is required.    </p>

<p>Sample - returning values</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">T* owner make_owner() {  
   T* owner  p = ...
   return p;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Sample  - initialization</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">T * owner b = make_owner();  
</code></pre>

<p>Sample  - calling functions</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">void f(T * owner a);
f(a);
</code></pre>

<p>When passing a owner pointer that points to const object to a owner pointer to non-const object the common warning discards &#39;const&#39; qualifier can be ignored.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">void fred(void * owner p);
const void * owner p = malloc(10);
free(p); //no warning
</code></pre>

<p>Sample - assignment</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">T * owner b = make_owner();
T * owner a = 0;  
...
a = b;  
</code></pre>

<p>Flow analysis must ensure <code>a</code> is not holding any resources before the assignment.</p>

<p>2 - When a <strong>owner pointer object</strong> is copied to a <strong>owner pointer to void</strong> only the ownership of the object is moved.</p>

<p>The pointed object also must have been released before.  </p>

<pre><code class="language-c">struct X { char * owner text; };   
int main() {
  struct X * owner p = malloc(1);  
  free(p-&gt;text); //moving the ownership of object
  free(p); //moving ownership of the memory  
}
</code></pre>

<p>3 - When a <strong>owner pointer</strong> is copied to a <strong>object owner pointer</strong> the ownership of the pointed object is moved, but not the ownership of the memory.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">struct X { char * owner text; };  
  
void x_destroy(struct X * obj_owner p){
  free(p-&gt;text);
}  

int main() {
  struct X x= {0};
  ...  
  x_destroy(&amp;x); //object moved
  free(p); //memory moved
}
</code></pre>

<p>4 - We can pass a <strong>view pointer to owner object</strong> as a <strong>object owner pointer</strong>. The object is moved.  </p>

<pre><code class="language-c"> struct X{
   char * owner text;
 };
 void x_destroy(struct X * obj_owner p){
  free(p-&gt;text);
}  
 int main() {
   struct X x = {0};
   x_destroy(&amp;x);//OK
 }
</code></pre>

<p>The exception is a function argument, or object returned by function.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c"> 
void x_destroy(struct X * obj_owner p){
  free(p-&gt;text);
}
void F(struct X * p)
{
  x_destroy(p);//ERROR
}
</code></pre>

<p>5 - We cannot pass <strong>view pointer to non owner object</strong> as a <strong>object owner pointer</strong>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c"> struct X{
   char * owner text;
 };
 void x_destroy(struct X * obj_owner p){
  free(p-&gt;text);
}  
 int main() {
   view struct X x = {0};
   x_destroy(&amp;x);//ERROR
 }
</code></pre>

<p>6 - A <strong>non owner object</strong> cannot be copied to a <strong>owner object</strong>.   </p>

<p>The only exception is the null pointer constant when copied to owner pointers.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">T * owner f() {
  return 0; //OK
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-c">int * p;
free(p); //error free requires an owner pointer
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-c">void x_delete(struct X * owner p);
struct X x;
x_delete(&amp;x); //error
</code></pre>

<p>7 - An <strong>owner object</strong> can be copied to a <strong>non-owner object</strong> if its lifetime is longer than that of the <strong>non-owner object</strong>.  </p>

<pre><code class="language-c">T F()
{
    owner T local;
    return local; /*error*/
} 
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-c">owner T global;
T F() {
   return global; //OK
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-c">T F(owner T arg) {
   return arg; //OK
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-c">  void F(T * p);
  F(make_owner()); //ERROR  
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-c">  T  *p = make_owner(); //ERROR
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-c">  T  *p = 0;  
  {
    T * owner p2 = make_owner();  
    p = p2; //error  
    free(p2);
  }
</code></pre>

<p>8 - Temporary <strong>owner objects</strong> cannot be discarded  </p>

<pre><code class="language-c">  make_owner(); //ERROR  
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-c">  void f(T * owner )//ERROR
  {
  }  
</code></pre>

<h2 id="toc_4">Part II - Flow analysis</h2>

<p>The objective of flow analysis is to ensure that when the lifetime of <strong>owner object</strong> ends, it must have  already released the resources it owns.<br>
The same when we overwrite the <strong>owner object</strong>.  </p>

<p>Sample:  </p>

<pre><code class="language-c">  FILE * owner f = fopen(&quot;file&quot;, &quot;r&quot;);  
  if (f){  
      fclose(f);
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Flow analysis must know that when f goes of of scope it does not owns any resource. </p>

<p>To track ownership fours states are used</p>

<ul>
<li>uninitialized</li>
<li>moved</li>
<li>null</li>
<li>not null<br></li>
</ul>

<p>We can assert compile time states in cake using <strong>static_state</strong></p>

<p>Sample:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">T * p;  
static_state(p, &quot;uninitialized&quot;);
</code></pre>

<p>We can also print object states using <strong>static_debug</strong>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">T * p;  
static_debug(p);
</code></pre>

<p>References can have the state &quot;null&quot; or &quot;not-null&quot;.</p>

<p>The combination of &quot;null or not-null&quot; is also called &quot;maybe-null&quot;.  </p>

<pre><code class="language-c">T * owner p = 0;  
static_state(p, &quot;null&quot;);

T * owner p2 = malloc(sizeof(T));  
static_state(p2, &quot;maybe-null&quot;);
</code></pre>

<p>When one owner object is copied to another the state of the source object is &quot;moved&quot;.  The state of the destination object is the same of the previous state of the source object.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">T * owner p1 = 0;  
T * owner p2 = malloc(sizeof(T));  

static_state(p1, &quot;null&quot;);
static_state(p2, &quot;maybe-null&quot;);

p1 = p2;  

static_state(p1, &quot;maybe-null&quot;);
static_state(p2, &quot;moved&quot;);

</code></pre>

<p>The exception is when we move owner objects into functions, then the state is &quot;uninitialized&quot;. This prevents use after free or concurrency problems.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">  T * owner p = malloc(sizeof(T));  
  free(p);
  static_state(p2, &quot;uninitialized&quot;);
</code></pre>

<p>The object state is a set of all possible states.  </p>

<p>Sample:  </p>

<pre><code class="language-c">  FILE * owner f = fopen(&quot;file&quot;, &quot;r&quot;);  
  if (f) {  
      fclose(f);
  }  
  static_state(f, &quot;null moved&quot;);
</code></pre>

<p>When an owning pointer goes out of scope and before its memory is overridden it cannot have &quot;not-null&quot; in its set state.   </p>

<p>All others possibilities are permitted. For instance, the state can be &quot;null or uninitialized&quot; or &quot;null or moved&quot;.</p>

<p>When an owning object (non pointer) goes out of scope and before its memory is overridden it must be on &quot;uninitialized&quot; or &quot;moved&quot; or &quot;uninitialized or moved&quot; state.
Structs an unions doesn&#39;t have a direct state. But we can say that some struct has been moved if all of its objects have been moved.</p>

<h3 id="toc_5">Special case malloc/calloc</h3>

<pre><code class="language-c">struct X {    
    char * owner name;
};

int main() {
  struct X * owner p = malloc(sizeof (struct X));
  p-&gt;name =  strdup(&quot;hi&quot;);
}
</code></pre>

<p>We must track that object <code>p-&gt;name</code> does not have any resources before the strdup assignment. We know malloc returns an uninitialized memory but the compiler does not known. </p>

<p>For this particular case the semantics of malloc/calloc will be built-in; So the static analyzer will know malloc returns a uninitialized memory and calloc return a zeroed memory allowing us to write the code above.</p>

<h3 id="toc_6">Disabling ownership checks</h3>

<p>Some functions can have a intricate logic of pointers and instead of trying to adapt the logic we know is correct, we can just annotate &quot;unchecked&quot; at function definition.  </p>

<pre><code class="language-c">void f() &quot;unchecked&quot; {  
}
</code></pre>

<p>So far, from the experience of using this feature in cake source itself, I have much less usages of &quot;unchecked&quot; than I was expecting initially.</p>

<p><strong>assert</strong> also can be used to override the static analysis state.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">/* linked list sample */

struct node {
 struct node* owner next;
};

struct list {
  struct node * owner head;
  struct node * tail;
};

void node_delete(struct node* owner p) {
  if (p) {
     assert(p-&gt;next == NULL);
     free(p);
  }
}

void list_destroy(struct list* obj_owner list)
{
  struct node * owner p = list-&gt;head;
  while (p) {
      struct node *  owner next = p-&gt;next;
      p-&gt;next = NULL;
      node_delete(p);
      p = next;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>list_destroy can be implemented as follow:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">void list_destroy(struct list* obj_owner list)
{
  struct node * owner p = list-&gt;head;
  while (p) {
      struct node *  owner next = p-&gt;next;
      free(p);
      p = next;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We don&#39;t need assert here because compiler knows &quot;p-&gt;next&quot; has been moved. We don&#39;t have a way do override the static analysis state &quot;moved&quot; or &quot;uninitialized&quot; using assert.</p>

<p>We also have <strong>static_set</strong> that can be used where assert does not work. For instance:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">  void* owner pnew = realloc(p-&gt;data, n * sizeof(p-&gt;data[0]));
  if (pnew == NULL) return ENOMEM;
  static_set(p-&gt;data, &quot;moved&quot;);
  p-&gt;data = pnew;
</code></pre>

<h2 id="toc_7">Grammar</h2>

<pre><code class="language-c">

TODO &quot;unchecked&quot;
</code></pre>

<h2 id="toc_8">Checking your source code</h2>

<p>I suggest the creation of a header file &quot;ownership.h&quot;</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">
#pragma once

#ifdef __CAKE__
#define owner owner
#define obj_owner obj_owner
#define view view
  
void* owner calloc(int nmemb, int size);
void free(implicit void* owner ptr);
void* owner malloc(int size);
void* owner realloc(void* owner ptr, int size);
char * owner strdup( const char *src );

#else
#define owner
#define obj_owner
#define view

#endif

</code></pre>

<p>Then include this header on the top of your files and just run cake.</p>

<p>The way I am thinking is..</p>

<p>I have variables, for instance  </p>

<p>int a = 1;<br>
int b = 2;
int c = 3;  </p>

<p>if (condition) {<br>
  a = 4;<br>
  b = 5;<br>
}
else {<br>
  a = 6;<br>
  c = 7;<br>
}    </p>

<p>// a is 4 or 6<br>
// b is 2 or 5<br>
// c is 3 or 7  </p>

<h2 id="toc_9">Terms</h2>

<h3 id="toc_10">storage duration</h3>

<p>An object has a storage duration that determines its lifetime. There are four storage durations: static, thread, automatic, and allocated. </p>

<h3 id="toc_11">lifetime</h3>

<p>The lifetime of an object is the portion of program execution during which storage is guaranteed to be reserved for it. An object exists, has a constant address and retains its last-stored value throughout its lifetime.</p>

<p>If an object is referred to outside of its lifetime, the behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>If a pointer value is used in an evaluation after the object the pointer points to (or just past) reaches
the end of its lifetime, the behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>The representation of a pointer object becomes indeterminate when the object the pointer points to (or just past) reaches the end of its lifetime.</p>

<h3 id="toc_12">value</h3>

<p>precise meaning of the contents of an object when interpreted as having a specific type</p>

<h3 id="toc_13">object</h3>

<p>Region of data storage in the execution environment, the contents of which can represent values.</p>

<h3 id="toc_14">owner object</h3>

<p>Is an object which value represents a reference to other object which lifetime is controlled by it.</p>
