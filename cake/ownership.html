<h2 id="toc_0">Owner Objects</h2>

<p>An <strong>owner object</strong> is an object referencing another object and managing its lifetime.</p>

<p>The most common type of owner objects is pointers, often referred to as <strong>owner pointers</strong>. An owner pointer is created with the qualifier owner, as illustrated in Listing 1:</p>

<h5>Listing 1 - Owner Pointer to FILE</h5>

<pre><code class="language-c">FILE *owner f = fopen(&quot;file.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;);
if (f)
    fclose(f);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Rule</strong>: An object cannot be owned for more than one owner object.   </p>

<p><strong>Rule</strong>: When owner objects are copied the ownership is transfered.</p>

<p>For example, in Listing 2, the ownership of the owner pointer <code>f</code> is transferred to <code>f2</code>:</p>

<h5>Listing 2 - Assignment of Owner Objects is a Move</h5>

<pre><code class="language-c">    FILE *owner f = fopen(&quot;file.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;);
    FILE *owner f2 = f; /*MOVED*/
    if (f2)
    fclose(f2);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong> Before the end of its lifetime, owner objects must transfer the ownership of the objects they own.</p>

<p>Invoking a function is analogous to assignment, resulting in the object’s transfer of ownership. In the previous examples, we were already transferring ownership of the owner pointer to the close function, which is declared as follows:</p>

<h5>Listing 3 - Declaration of close</h5>

<pre><code class="language-c">void close(FILE *owner p);
</code></pre>

<h3 id="toc_1">Non pointer Owner Objects</h3>

<p>We can have other types of <strong>owner objects</strong>. For instance, Berkeley sockets use an integer to identify the socket, as shown in listing 4:</p>

<h5>Listing 4 - Non-Pointer owners objects</h5>

<pre><code class="language-c"> owner int server_socket =
     socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
 /*...*/
 close(server_socket);
</code></pre>

<h2 id="toc_2">View Objects</h2>

<p>A <strong>view object</strong> is an object referencing another object without managing its lifetime. The lifetime of the referenced object must be bigger than the lifetime of the view object.</p>

<p>The most common view objects are pointers called <strong>view pointers</strong>. </p>

<p>The view qualifier is not necessary for pointers, since it&#39;s the default behavior. When an owner object is copied to a view object, the ownership is not transferred, as shown in Listing 5:</p>

<h5>Listing 5 - Calling Function with View Parameters</h5>

<pre><code class="language-c">void use_file(FILE *f) {
}
int main() {
    FILE *owner f = fopen(&quot;file.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;);
    if (f) {
        use_file(f); /*NOT MOVED*/
        fclose(f);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When a <strong>view</strong> qualifier is used in structs, it makes all members as view objects. Listing 6.</p>

<h5>Listing 6 - A view parameter</h5>

<pre><code class="language-c">struct X {   
  char *owner text;   
};  

void f(view struct X x) { /*...*/ }  

int main() {
    struct X x = {};
    f(x); /*NOT MOVED*/    
    free(x.text);
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="toc_3">Deleting Owner Pointers</h2>

<p><strong>Owner pointers</strong> take on the responsibility of owning the pointed object and its associated memory, treating them as distinct entities. A common practice is to implement a delete function to release both resources, as illustrated in Listing 7:</p>

<h5>Listing 7 - Implementing the delete function</h5>

<pre><code class="language-c">struct X { 
  char *owner text; 
};
void x_delete(struct X *owner p) {
  if (p) {
    /*releasing the object*/ 
    free(p-&gt;text);
    
    /*releasing the memory*/ 
    free(p); 
  }
}
int main() {
  struct X * owner pX = calloc( 1, sizeof * pX);
  if (pX) {
    /*...*/;
    x_delete( pX); 
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When the object is created on the stack, we can implement a destructor, as shown in Listing 8:</p>

<h5>Listing 8 - Implementing a destructor</h5>

<pre><code class="language-c">struct X {
    char *owner text;
};  
void x_destroy(struct X x) {
    free(x.text);
}  
int main() {
    struct X x = {};
    /*...*/
    x_destroy(x); /*x is moved*/
}
</code></pre>

<p>However in C, structs are typically passed by pointer rather than by value. To transfer the ownership of an owner object to a pointer, we introduce a new qualifier, <strong>obj_owner</strong>. </p>

<p>A pointer qualified with <strong>obj_owner</strong> is the owner of the pointed object but not responsible for managing its memory.</p>

<p>Listing 9 illustrates how to implement a destructor using a obj_owner pointer parameter.</p>

<h5>Listing 9 - Implementing a destructor using obj_owner</h5>

<pre><code class="language-c">struct X {
    char *owner text;
};
void x_destroy(struct X *obj_owner x) {
    free(x-&gt;text);
}
int main() {
    struct X x = {};
    /*more code*/
    x_destroy(&amp;x); /*x is moved*/
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="toc_4">Copying a owner pointer to a obj_owner pointer</h2>

<p>We can copy an owner pointer to an <strong>obj_owner</strong> pointer. In this scenario, only the ownership of the pointed object is transferred, not the memory ownership. Listing 10 illustrates how we can use <code>x_destroy</code> in the implementation of <code>x_delete</code>.</p>

<h5>Listing 10 - Using <code>x_destroy</code> to implement <code>x_delete</code></h5>

<pre><code class="language-c">struct X {
  char *owner text; 
};

void x_destroy(struct X *obj_owner x) {
  free(x-&gt;text); 
}

void x_delete(struct X *owner p) { 
  if (p) {
    x_destroy(p); /* *p is moved*/
    free(p);
  }
}

int main() {
   struct X * owner pX = calloc( 1, sizeof * pX);
   if (pX) {
     /*...*/;
     x_delete( pX); 
   }
 } 
</code></pre>

<h2 id="toc_5">Static analysis</h2>

<p>All the rules we have presented are checked by the compiler. Let&#39;s revisit our first example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">FILE *owner f = fopen(&quot;file.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;);
if (f)
    fclose(f);
</code></pre>

<p>The flow analysis must ensure that when the owner pointer ‘f’ goes out of scope, it does not own any objects. At the end of the scope, ‘f’ can be either null or moved, and both states ensure that there are no remaining resources.</p>

<p>To check the ownership rules, the compiler uses five states:</p>

<ul>
<li>uninitialized</li>
<li>moved</li>
<li>null</li>
<li>not-null</li>
<li>zero</li>
</ul>

<p>We can print these states using the <strong>static_debug</strong> declaration. We can also assert the variable is at a certain state using the <strong>static_state</strong> declaration. Listing 11 shows this usage:</p>

<h5>Listing 11 - Usage of <strong>static_state</strong> and <strong>static_debug</strong></h5>

<pre><code class="language-c">int main() {
 int a;   
 static_state(a, &quot;uninitialized&quot;);  
 static_debug(a);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>source:5:2: note: static_debug
 5 | static_debug(a);
   | ^~~~~~~~~~~~
   a == &quot;uninitialized&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>As we have just seen, the <strong>uninitialized</strong> state is the state of variables that are declared but not initialized. The compiler ensures that we don&#39;t read uninitialized objects.</p>

<p>The <strong>null</strong> state means that owner objects are not referencing any object. Listing 12 shows a sample using owner pointers:</p>

<h5>Listing 12 - Null state</h5>

<pre><code class="language-c">int main() {
 void * owner p = nullptr;   
 static_state(p, &quot;null&quot;); 
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>not-null</strong> state indicates that the object is referencing some object, as shown in listing 13.</p>

<h5>Listing 13 - Not-null state</h5>

<pre><code class="language-c">int main()
{
   void * owner p = malloc(1);
   if (p) {
     static_state(p, &quot;not-null&quot;);
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>zero</strong> state is used for non-owner objects to complement and support uninitialized checks.</p>

<h5>Listing 14 - The zero state</h5>

<pre><code class="language-c">int main()
{
   int i = 0;
   static_state(i, &quot;zero&quot;);   
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Zero</strong> and <strong>null</strong> are different states. This difference is necessary because, for non-pointers like the socket sample, 0 does not necessarily mean null. The compiler does not know the semantics for types that are not pointers. However, you can use <strong>static_set</strong> to override states. In Listing 15, we annotate that server_socket is null, which doesn&#39;t mean it is zero but indicates that it is not holding any resources and is safe to return without calling close.</p>

<h5>Listing 15 - Usage of static_set</h5>

<pre><code class="language-c">  owner int server_socket =
     socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
  if (server_socket &lt; 0) {  
     static_set(server_socket, &quot;null&quot;);
     return;
  }  
 /*...*/
 close(server_socket);
</code></pre>

<p>Now let&#39;s consider <code>realloc</code> function.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">void * owner realloc( void *ptr, size_t new_size ); 
</code></pre>

<p>In the declaration of <code>realloc</code>, we are not moving the ptr. The reason for that is because the <code>ptr</code> may or may not be moved. If the function returns NULL, <code>ptr</code> was not moved. Listing 16 shows how <strong>static_set</strong> can be used.</p>

<h5>Listing 16 - Using static_set with realloc</h5>

<pre><code class="language-c">  void * owner p = malloc(1);
  void * owner p2 = realloc(p, 2);
  if (p2 != 0)
  {
     /*
        if p2 != 0 it  means p was moved.
     */
     static_set(p, &quot;moved&quot;);
     p = p2;
  }    
  free(p);
</code></pre>

<p>The state of an object is a combination of all possible states. For instance, let&#39;s print and check the state of <code>f</code> at listing 17.</p>

<h5>Listing 17 - Flow analysis</h5>

<pre><code class="language-c">int main() {
  FILE *owner f = fopen(&quot;file.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;);
  if (f)
    fclose(f);  
  static_state(f, &quot;null or moved&quot;);
  static_debug(f);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">source:13:3: note: static_debug
 13 |  static_debug(f);
    |  ^~~~~~~~~~~~
    f == &quot;null or moved&quot;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong> We cannot discard owner objects as showed in listing 18.  </p>

<h5>Listing 18 - owner objects cannot be discarded.</h5>

<pre><code class="language-c">void using_file(FILE * f);
int main() {  
 fopen(&quot;file.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;); //ERROR  
 using_file(fopen(&quot;file.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;)); //ERROR
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong> Before the assignment of owner objects, the compiler checks if the owner object is not holding any resource, as shown in Listing 19:</p>

<h5>Listing 19 - Check before assignment</h5>

<pre><code class="language-c">  FILE * owner file = fopen(&quot;file.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;);  
  file = fopen(&quot;file.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;); //ERROR
</code></pre>

<p>Sometimes is not possible to infer the state. Consider this sample.</p>

<h5>Listing 20 - Some states cannot be inferred</h5>

<pre><code class="language-c">struct X {
  char *owner text; 
};
void init(struct  X * x) {
  x-&gt;text = strdup(&quot;a&quot;);
}
</code></pre>

<p>How to know <code>x-&gt;text</code> was not holding any resource? At  listing 21, we show how <strong>static_set</strong> can be used to say <code>x-&gt;text</code> is not initialized at <code>init</code>. </p>

<h5>Listing 21 - Using static_set</h5>

<pre><code class="language-c">void init(struct  X * x) {  
  static_set(x-&gt;text, &quot;uninitialized&quot;);
  x-&gt;text = strdup(&quot;a&quot;);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The runtime assert is also used by the compiler. Consider the following sample where we have a linked list. Each node has owner pointer to next. The next pointer of the tail of the list is always pointing to null, unless we have a bug. But the compiler does not know <code>list-&gt;tail-&gt;next</code> is null. Using assert we give this inform to the compiler and we also have a runtime check for possible logic bugs.</p>

<p>Listing 22 shows the usage of assert. </p>

<pre><code class="language-c">struct node {
 char * owner text;
 struct node* owner next;
};

struct list {
  struct node * owner head;
  struct node * tail;
};

void list_append(struct list* list, struct node* owner node)
{
  if (list-&gt;head == NULL) {
      list-&gt;head = node;
   }
   else {
      assert(list-&gt;tail-&gt;next == 0);
      list-&gt;tail-&gt;next = node;
   }
   list-&gt;tail = node;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong> A non-owner object cannot be copied to a owner object. </p>

<p>But, the null pointer constant is converted to a null owner pointer. Se listing 23.</p>

<h5>Listing 23 - non owner cannot be copied to owner</h5>

<pre><code class="language-c">FILE * f();
int main() {  
   FILE * owner file = f(); //ERROR   
   FILE * owner file2 = 0;  //OK
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong> A view pointer parameter cannot leave the scope with moved/uninitialized objects. Listing 24</p>

<h5>Listing 24 - Messing with view parameters</h5>

<pre><code class="language-c">void f(struct Y * p) {
    x_destroy(p-&gt;px);
} //ERROR p-&gt;x is leaving scope MOVED
  
int main() {
   struct Y  y = {};
   y.x.name = strdup(&quot;a&quot;);
   f(&amp;y);
   free(y.x.name);
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, listing 25 is correct, because before the end of scope states of the parameters are restored.</p>

<h5>Listing 25 - swap function</h5>

<pre><code class="language-c">void x_swap(struct X * a, struct X * b) {
  struct X temp = *a;
  *a = *b;
  *b = temp;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong> When objects are moved to functions, they become uninitialized. This prevents bugs like double free. Listing 26. </p>

<pre><code> int main() {
  void * owner p = malloc(1);
  free(p);
  free(p); //ERROR p is uninitialized
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong> moved objects cannot be moved. Listing 27.</p>

<h5>Listing 27 - We cannot move a moved or uninitialized object</h5>

<pre><code class="language-c">int * owner p1 = ...;
int * owner p2 = p1;
int * owner p3 = p1; //ERROR p1 was moved
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong> When coping a owner object to to a view object the compiler must check the lifetime. Listing 28</p>

<h5>Listing 28 - Lifetime check</h5>

<pre><code class="language-c">struct X { 
  char *owner text; 
};  
  
struct X * owner make_owner();  

int main() {
  struct X *p = 0;  
  {
    struct X * owner p2 = make_owner();  
    p = p2; //error p lives longer than p2  
    free(p2);
  }  
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong> const can be discard when moving to <code>void*</code>. Listing 29</p>

<h5>Listing 29 - Non warning discarding const.</h5>

<pre><code class="language-c">void free(void * owner p);
int main(){
  const void * p = malloc(1);
  free(p); //no discarding const warning here
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong> To convert a view pointer to obj_owner we need check that the origin (the object it is pointing) is an owner object. Listing 30.</p>

<h5>Listing 30 - Checking the origin of obj_owner</h5>

<pre><code class="language-c">struct X {
 struct Y * p;
};
void y_destroy(struct Y * obj_owner p);
void f(struct X * x) {
  y_destroy(x-&gt;y); //ERROR origin of y cannot be verified
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Rule</strong> When we cast void pointer to objects we assume the object is uninitialized. Listing 31  </p>

<h5>Listing 31 - void objects are uninitialized</h5>

<pre><code class="language-c">struct X { 
  char *owner text; 
};
void x_delete(struct X *owner p);  

int main() 
{
   struct X * pX = calloc( 1, sizeof * pX);
   if (pX) {
     static_state(pX-&gt;text, &quot;uninitialized&quot;);
     p-&gt;text = strdup(&quot;hi&quot;); 
     x_delete( pX); 
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When calloc is used, the memory is initialized with zeros.
if necessary, <strong>state_set</strong> can be used with &quot;zero&quot; parameter to tell the compiler the state of the pointed object. Listing 32.</p>

<h5>Listing 32 - Zeroing the state</h5>

<pre><code class="language-c">struct X { 
  char *owner text; 
};
int main() 
{
   struct X * pX = calloc( 1, sizeof * pX);
   if (pX) {  
     /*the memory of pointed object is all zeroes*/
     static_state(*p, &quot;zero&quot;);          
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>For pointers zero state means null.</p>

<p><strong>Rule</strong> : We cannot return moved or non-initialized objects. All returned objects are in a valid state.</p>

<h5>Listing 33 - Returning invalid object</h5>

<pre><code class="language-c">void* owner malloc(unsigned long size);
void free(void* owner ptr);

struct X { 
  char *owner text; 
};

struct X * owner f() 
{
   struct X * owner pX = malloc(sizeof * pX);
   return pX;
}
</code></pre>

<h5>Listing 34 - Assuming returned objects are valid</h5>

<pre><code class="language-c">void* owner malloc(unsigned long size);
void free(void* owner ptr);

struct X { 
  char *owner text; 
};

struct X * owner f();

int main()
{
   struct X * owner pX = f();
   if (pX) {
     static_state(pX-&gt;text, &quot;maybe-null&quot;);
   }
}
</code></pre>
