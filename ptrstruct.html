<h1 id="toc_0">what if structs were passed by pointers?</h1>

<p>On early versions of C, structs could not be passed as functions arguments 
direclty, only pointer to struct could be used. </p>

<p>At the first edition of &quot;The C programming language&quot; we can see this was not
impemented yet.[1]</p>

<p>Besides, structs arguments, returning structs from funtions were not allowed
and copy was not implemented. All this features came together. </p>

<p>This was the point in history where the decision &quot;pass structs by copy or reference&quot; was made.</p>

<p>BYTE magazine 1983 has an intersting description.</p>

<p>&quot;Some compilers accept the structure name without &amp; while still passing
only a pointer...&quot; [2]</p>

<p>This tell us some compilers were passing structs by refefernce even without
address of operator. I imagine the declaration of the argument still a pointer.</p>

<p>What are the reason behing this design? 
Maybe because &quot;const&quot; was not added yet, so this would be a way to prevent 
unwanted changes on the structs?
Maybe because simple types are passed with copy?</p>

<p>You also may imagine the design was choosen to not create an expetion on the type
system. But the exepeton already exists. </p>

<p>Arrays are passed by reference.</p>

<p>Many decalers later, I write C code and 99.9%  of time I pass
structs by pointers.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
struct X { int i; };

void F(struct X x) { x.i = 2; /*changes a copy*/}

int main() {
  struct X x = {0};
  F(x);
  printf(&quot;%d&quot;, x.i); //prints 0
}

</code></pre>

<p>Some compilers use to pass structs to function without &amp; as we can 
see on Byte magazine August 1983, pag 168</p>

<p>&quot;Some compilers accept the structure
name without &amp; while still passing
only a pointer, and they mayor may
not give a warning message telling
what&#39;s going on. Obviously this can
lead to trouble if you then transport
that code into a true Unix version 7
environment.&quot; [2]</p>

<p>I didn[t find the motivation for this design, but I may suspect
that the objective was to make each function </p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void F(int a[10]) { a[0] = 2; }

int main() {
  int a[] = {0, 0, 0};
  F(a);
  printf(&quot;%d&quot;, a[0]); //prints 2
}

</code></pre>

<p>Most of code I write in C pass structs by pointer because
most of time we don´t need copies.</p>

<p>[1] See first edition of &quot;The C programming language &quot; 1978.</p>

<p>&quot;There are a number of restrictions on C structures. The essential rules
are that the only operations that you can perform on a structure are take its
address with &amp;, and access one of its members. This implies that structures
may not be assigned to or copied as a unit, and that they can not be passed
to or returned from functions.&quot; </p>
